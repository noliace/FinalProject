                <h2>BRIEF HISTORY OF THE LYCEUM OF APARRI</h2>
                <p>Acting upon the persistent requests of parents along the coastal towns, Archbishop Teodulfo S. Domingo opened the LYCEUM OF APARRI on July 5, 1967. It was established on a lot owned and acquired from the Talamayan, Garcia and Pablo families. Msgr. Diosdado A. Talamayan, the Archbishop of Tuguegarao, was appointed as its first Rector. Rev. Gregorio Pagulayan was the first Registrar-Comptroller. The following courses were offered during the school’s first year of operation: Complete Four-Year Secondary Course, First Year Liberal Arts and Business Administration.


                    In August of 1969, when Monsignor Talamayan left for the post-graduate degree in Teacher Education at Columbia University in New York, Rev. Fr. Vicente Catral and Rev. Fr. Jose Aquino were appointed Acting Rector and Comptroller, respectively. In 1969, during the term of Rev. Quintin Garcia and Rev. Arnulfo Ventura as Rector and Comptroller, permits for the Bachelor of Science in Secondary Education and Bachelor of Science in Elementary Education were obtained. In August 1970, Monsignor Talamayan reassumed his post as head of the school with the title of President. In 1971, permits for complete Elementary Course and Associate in Secretarial Course were obtained. In 1972, the ROTC Department was activated as a separate unit. Aside from obtaining full recognition of all courses, permits for Master of Arts in Education, Two-Year Course in Accounting Aide, Two-Year Course in Junior Secretarial, One-Year General Clerical Course, and One-Year Bookkeeping were obtained.

                    <br><br>
                    Lyceum of Aparri continued to expand with the offering of different major fields of concentration in Education and Business Administration.

                    <br>
                    To answer the growing needs of the community for medical care and to prepare the way for the eventual offering of medical courses, the Lyceum of Aparri Hospital was opened in 1980. Now, a new and bigger hospital building is built and medical services with the new set of equipment and facilities are made accessible to the public last April 7, 2002.
                    
                    
                    In 1982, government recognition was granted to the two-year Course in Midwifery; in 1985, the three-year Associate in Geodetic Engineering and the five-year Course in Civil Engineering: and in, 1990, the Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration.
                    
                    
                    Together with curricular expansion, the school is continuously working to improve its human and physical resources. The College was granted Level I Accreditation by the Philippine Association of College and Universities (PACU) in January of 1987. A year after, this was upgraded to Level II Accredited Status on March 9, 1988 and was further re-accredited with the same status on January 3, 1991, all under the leadership of Fr. Ranhilio C.

                    <br>
                    <br>
                    From 1993 to 1995, Monsignor Quinto took over Father Aquino’s post after the latter was re- assigned. As executive Vice President of the Lyceum, Monsignor Quinto worked of the granting of a permit for Associate in Marine Transportation which was granted in the year 1995.

Reyes as Executive Vice President, the school saw an unprecedented improvement surge in both curricular expansion and physical development. The construction and transfer to a new location of the new Lyceum of Aparri Hospital is an inviolable proof of the Archdiocese’s commitment to serving the people in this part of the province. Rev.

                    Subsequently, in November 1996, the school was given Level II 2nd Re-Accreditation for having satisfactorily met the standards and complied with the requirements of the PACU-COA in the Liberal Arts, Commerce and Education Programs. This distinction is valid until 2001.
