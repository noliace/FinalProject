                    <p>A conference is generally understood as a meeting of several people to discuss a particular topic. It is often confused with a convention, colloquia or symposium. A convention is larger than a conference; it is a gathering of delegates representing several groups.</p>

The FEU Cheering Squad, which paid tribute to the King of Pop Michael Jackson, was first runner-up with 706 points.</p>
